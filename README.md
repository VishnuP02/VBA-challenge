# VBA-challenge

In this challenge, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.

Resources:
The resources that I used to complete the challenge were my lecture notes/slides, class recordings, stackoverflow, and a tutoring session with TA Mark Fullton
